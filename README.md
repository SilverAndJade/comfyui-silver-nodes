## Features

Silver Nodes provides several specialized nodes designed to improve your ComfyUI workflows:

## Nodes

### Silver Lora Model Loader

A specialized LoRA model loader that allows cycling through models with various selection strategies.

#### Features

- **Regex Filtering**: Filter LoRA models by name using regular expressions
- **Sequential Selection**: Increment, decrement, or randomize through filtered models
- **Repeat Control**: Apply the same LoRA multiple times before moving to the next

#### Parameters

- `regex_filter`: Regular expression to filter available LoRA models
- `lora_name`: Currently selected LoRA model
- `action`: Selection strategy (fixed, increment, decrement, randomize)
- `repeat_count`: Number of times to use the same LoRA before changing
- `current_repeat`: Current repeat iteration

### Silver Folder Image Loader

Loads images from a specified folder with advanced sorting and selection options.

#### Features

- **Batch Loading**: Load multiple images at once
- **Flexible Sorting**: Sort by name, creation date, modification date, or file size
- **Sort Direction**: Choose ascending or descending order
- **Selection Strategies**: Fixed position, increment, decrement, or wrap-around

#### Parameters

- `folder_path`: Path to the folder containing images
- `batch_size`: Number of images to load at once
- `current_index`: Starting position in the sorted file list
- `action`: Selection strategy (fixed, increment, decrement, increment_wrap, reset)
- `sort_by`: Sorting criterion (name, created, modified, size)
- `sort_order`: Sort direction (ascending, descending)

### Silver File Text Loader

Loads text from files with options for splitting and sequential selection.

#### Features

- **Text Splitting**: Split by line or paragraph
- **Sequential Access**: Increment, decrement, or randomize through text segments

#### Parameters

- `file_path`: Path to the text file
- `split_mode`: How to split the text (by line, by paragraph)
- `current_index`: Current position in the split text
- `action`: Selection strategy (fixed, increment, decrement, randomize)


## Usage Examples

### Cycling Through LoRA Models

1. Add the Silver Lora Model Loader to your workflow
2. Set a regex filter (e.g., "style.*" to match all style LoRAs)
3. Set action to "increment" to cycle through matching models
4. Connect the output to your workflow

### Processing a Folder of Images

1. Add the Silver Folder Image Loader to your workflow
2. Set the folder path containing your images
3. Configure batch size and sorting options
4. Set action to "increment" to process images sequentially
5. Connect the image output to your processing nodes

### Using the String Replacer

The Silver String Replacer node allows you to perform text substitutions with support for random selection from multiple alternatives.

#### Pattern Format

Each replacement rule is defined on a new line in the format:
```
search_term:replacement_1:replacement_2:replacement_3:...
```
- The first part is the text to search for
- Subsequent parts (after colons) are possible replacements
- One replacement is randomly selected when a match is found

#### Example 1: Simple Replacement
```
dog:cat
```
- Replaces all occurrences of "dog" with "cat"

#### Example 2: Multiple Replacements
```
dog:cat:puppy:wolf
```
- Randomly replaces "dog" with either "cat", "puppy", or "wolf"

#### Example 3: Multiple Rules
```
dog:cat:puppy:wolf
house:home:apartment:building
```
- Replaces "dog" with a random animal
- Replaces "house" with a random dwelling

### Using Text Prompts from a File

1. Add the Silver File Text Loader to your workflow
2. Set the path to your text file containing prompts
3. Choose split mode based on how your prompts are formatted
4. Set action to "increment" to use a different prompt each run
5. Connect the text output to your prompt input
